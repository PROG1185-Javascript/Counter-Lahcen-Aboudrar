# Shopping Cart Page

This is a simple HTML page with JavaScript functionality to add or remove products from a shopping cart.

## Usage

To use this page, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You will see a counter indicating the number of products currently in the cart. You can add products to the cart by clicking the "Add to cart" button, and remove products by clicking the "Remove from cart" button.

## Files

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the shopping cart page.
- `style.css`: Optional CSS file containing styles for the shopping cart page.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing functions to add or remove products from the cart.

## How It Works

The JavaScript functions `addToCart()` and `removeFromCart()` handle the addition and removal of products from the cart. These functions update the product count displayed on the page.
